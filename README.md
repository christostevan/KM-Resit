## Start react native project
1. If needed, mount the project folder by typing:  
   `cd .\KM-Resit\WeatherApp`  
2. Install the required dependencies using:
	`npm install`
3. Start the server using:  
 `npm start`
4. To run the web application, type `"w"` (without the brackets) in the terminal. 
5. If the project started successfully, a QR code can be scanned for the mobile app version (**Expo Go** client app needs to be installed on the phone); an alternative solution is to simply type `"a"` in the terminal, it will then build and host the app on mobile version while giving you a link that you can enter into in your **Expo Go** app on your mobile phone.
6. Another solution is to install a mobile emulator on your computer, install **Expo Go** and enter the link from there.
